The code is about simply calculating the area of a triangle. And testing a simple print statement.

In my own view a triangle has 3 points, 3 lengths and 3 angles. Among these 9 attributes a triangle requires at least 3 to be properly defined. And in order to calculate the area we require base and height which can be extracted from a well defined triangle. If need be I can start the calculation from this information (let's say 3 points). Which will require me to use two point form to solve for lines and then perpendiculars finding exercise. Extracting base and height and then multiplying.
